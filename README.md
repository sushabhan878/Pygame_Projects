# Pygame_Projects

Welcome to **Pygame_Projects**! 🎮

This repository is a collection of games I am building as I learn and explore the **Pygame** module. My goal is to improve my understanding of Pygame concepts and game development, starting with simple projects and progressively moving towards more challenging ones.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Learn Pygame from scratch.
- Build various games, starting from **easy** and advancing to **hard**.
- Improve my coding and problem-solving skills while having fun.

## 🕹️ Games List

1. **Rain Dodge** *(Easy)*  
2. **Galaxy Fighters** *(Easy)*  
3. **Space Invaders** *(Medium)*  
4. **Car Racing Game** *(Medium)*  
5. **Checkers** *(Medium)*  
6. **Pong** *(Medium)*  
7. **2048** *(Hard)*
